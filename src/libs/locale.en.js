`Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done 
on earth, as it is in heaven.
Give us this day 
our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses, 
as we forgive those who trespass against us,
and lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.`,
    [prayers.get('Little Consecration').prayer]:
`My Queen, my Mother,
I give myself entirely to you,
and to show my devotion to you,
I consecrate to you this day
my eyes, my ears, my mouth, my heart,
my entire self without reserve.
As I am your own, my good Mother,
guard me and defend me
as your property and possession.
Amen.`
